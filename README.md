# API PRO - Promotional Website

API PRO is a fictional all-in-one API Management Platform. This 5-page responsive website was built as part of a frontend developer assessment.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **React (Vite)**
- **React Router DOM**
- **Plain CSS**
- **Axios** (for API fetching)
- **Cursor AI** (AI-assisted coding)

## ðŸ“„ Pages

1. **Home** â€“ Hero section, features, social proof, and navigation buttons
2. **About Us** â€“ Mission statement + dynamic team cards using data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
3. **Pricing** â€“ 3 pricing plans with Pro marked as "Most Popular"
4. **Documentation** â€“ Two-column layout with sidebar + API endpoint example
5. **Contact Us** â€“ Contact form + address, email, and phone info

## ðŸ¤– AI Tools Used

**Cursor AI (https://cursor.so)**  
Cursor was used throughout this project for:

- Generating JSX layouts for all 5 pages
- Creating CSS files and styling suggestions
- Auto-completing React code, including routing and component structure
- Refactoring UI and handling responsiveness
- API fetching with `useEffect` and `axios`

> Example: I used Cursor to generate the Pricing cards layout with a "Most Popular" badge and responsive styling. It saved hours by automating layout, animation, and class naming.
